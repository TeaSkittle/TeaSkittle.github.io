    <p>This is just my very simple EDC of stuff that I actually carry and use everyday, wanted to add it to this blog for two reasons:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>To keep a record of it for the future, as I'm planning on changing a few things
      <li>I wanted to add something to this blog and this was a decent excuse for a post
    </ol>
