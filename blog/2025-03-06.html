    <h1>Quake Aftershock - Revisiting My Old Quake Blog</h1>
    <p>Back in 2018 I was playing a lot of Quake Champions and other Arena FPS games. Sadly, since my time of playing the arena shooter genre has dwindled pretty significantly.  Looking at <a href="https://steamcharts.com/search/?q=quake">Steam Charts</a> is pretty revealing to the whole genre, Quake Live and Quake Champions are the two most played games in the genre and each only get 30 day averages of 250+ players. No other games comes close either. However even though I am not playing games much these days, I still do enjoy this genre a lot. So much so that back in 2018 I actually created a blog and was thinking about streaming the game: <a href="https://teaskittle.blogspot.com/">https://teaskittle.blogspot.com/</a>.</p>

    <p>I wanted to archive a few of the posts from that blog her on my website, so that is what blog entry will be about. Mainly all I discussed in the few blog posts on this old quake site was talking about aim/sensitivity stuff related to the game. Without further ado, letâ€™s get into those old posts!</p>

    <h2>Let's Talk About Aim</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! So one of the first things that I really wanted to get down in Quake Champions, or any FPS for that matter, is my aim. But this is way harder than it sounds, as getting your settings just right can be complicated and take some time. So like many newcomers, I decided to look at the settings and configurations of the pros. I ended up finding this spreadsheet via Reddit: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xen7wvBiIqZtLwsDuWzjB55QyCtZYQA9pcesxf09NQc/edit#gid=0">Spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<p>One thing I concluded after looking at this was that there is not one shoes that fits all. Everyone is different. But a few things did peak my curiosity. Firstly only three of them use a fov higher than 120, and only two of them have one lower than 110. Interesting, so a good sweet spot is somewhere between 110 and 120. I assume that is where a good balance of aim and awareness meet. The second thing I noticed is only 6 of them have a dpi higher than 1000. This inst too surprising as higher dpi tends to be a marketing ploy more than something that has major impact of your performance. Anything higher than 1600 is rather ridiculous. And lastly 6 of them use mouse acceleration. Wait what?</p>

<p>Ya, if you do some research into the older quake games it was very common for high level players to use mouse acceleration. I did a simple search on Reddit and found some good opinions of mouse acceleration.</p>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QuakeLive/comments/5xhgev/why_mouse_accel/">https://www.reddit.com/r/QuakeLive/comments/5xhgev/why_mouse_accel/</a>
<br><br>
I won't go into much detail but here are the basics:
<br><br>
Pros:
<ul>
  <li>Ability to do fast flick shots, or 180 degree turns</li>
  <li>Can have low sensitivity for tracking with lighting gun, with high acceleration to flick</li>
  <li>Can be insanely customized to find the perfect sensitivity</li>
  <li>Can play well without having to use a massive mouse-pad</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul>
  <li>More difficult to be consistent</li>
  <li>Steep learning curve</li>
  <li>Can take a while to set up the perfect mouse settings</li>
  <li>Can be complicated with setting up at LANs</li>
</ul>

    <p>I think these are all things worth considering if you are debating on trying mouse acceleration, and if you do decide to try it I highly recommend using the software and driver created by both Povohat and Kovaak. Here is a video showing the software:</p>

<p>I highly recommenced at least giving it a try for a few hours or a few days, I did and honestly it ended up being tremendously helpful to my game. Last night I played a TDM where I got 11 impressive medals, my rail was terrible before I got these settings down. That completely changed my previous notions of mouse acceleration.</p>

<h2>Let's Talk About Aim - Part 2</h2>
<p>So after a few weeks of playing with mouse acceleration(see my previous post about this), I decided to go back to using no mouse acceleration in Quake. I decided to try this because my aim was, well inconsistent with acceleration. I liked the logical ideals behind acceleration(i.e. being able to track well, and also being able to flick on command), but it really threw off my muscle memory at times. I started to find it is really quite difficult to calculate on the fly both the distance your mouse needs to move to land a precise shot, and also factor in the speed at which you do this. One thing to note here is that I was using a low sensitivity at 41.5cm/360 with a lower acceleration rate, so the acceleration wasn't even that much and it was enough to throw off my muscle memory. These are the setting I was using:</p>

dpi = 800<br>
In-Game Sensitivity = 1.25<br>
Sensitivity = 1<br>
Acceleration = 0.0175<br>
Sensitivity Cap = 1.4<br>
Offset = 1.5<br>
Power = 2<br>
Pre-ScaleX = 1<br>
Pre-ScaleY = 1<br>
Post-ScaleX = 1<br>
Post-ScaleY = 1<br>
AngleAdjustment = 0<br>
AngleSnapping = 0<br>
SpeedCap = 0<br>
FancyOutput = 0<br>

<p>Compared to a lot of players I have seen who use acceleration, this is quite low. So I began experimenting and started out at 1.25 sensitivity and raised it over time. As of writing this post I am using:</p>

dpi = 800<br>
In-Game Sensitivity =  1.5<br>
No Acceleration<br>

    <p>After using these settings for a while I found it to be more consistent than using acceleration. But this is just for me, I think acceleration is great for certain players, but we all have different preferences, hands, grip styles, and play styles. For some acceleration is wonderful, for others it may just not be the shoe that fits. With doing a lot of this testing I played many games of instagib, here is a clip of me playing with these current settings that I am quite happy with.</p>

    <p>Hope my experimenting helps you in your Quake journey, cheers</p>

    <h2>Calculating cm/360</h2>
    <p><i>The old post I made for this subject, which you can find <a href="https://teaskittle.blogspot.com/2018/05/cm360-calculator_29.html">here</a>, used an old python script that I had lost. I went ahead and recreated it in Perl as I have been experimenting with Perl lately. This was also a short blog entry so I have fully recreated it for this new site.</i></p>

    <p>There are several sites out there that you can use to calculate your cm/360 for your mouse sensitivity, this was just a fun exercise to do. When I was learning to program in Python I figured this would be a good challenge, and it is! Like stated above that old Python script has been lost and I went ahead and re-wrote it in Perl. What I really needed was the basic formula for calculating it, which I was able to find: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150107154939/http://www.funender.com/quake/mouse/index.html">here</a>.</p>

    The formula is:<br>
    c = (360 / (yaw * dpi * windows-multiplier * sensitivity)) * 2.54<br>
    <br>
    Some things to note here:
    <ul>
      <li>C is the cm/360 value we are trying to find</li>
      <li>Yaw for quake is defaulted to 0.22</li>
      <li>Windows-mutiplier should be one, unless you change the windows sensitivity away from 6/11</li>
      <li>In the below script I left windows-mulitplier out as almost no one really changes this value</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is the Perl script I created:</p>
    <p style="color:Green">
      #!/usr/bin/perl<br>
use strict;<br>
use warnings;<br>
<br>
my $yaw = 0.022;<br>
print "Enter your DPI: ";<br>
my $dpi = &lt;STDIN&gt;;<br>
chomp $dpi;<br>
print "Enter your in-game sensitivity: ";<br>
my $sens = &lt;STDIN&gt;;<br>
chomp $sens;<br>
<br>
sub alg {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return (360 / ($yaw * $dpi * $sens)) * 2.54;<br>
}<br>
<br>
print "Your cm/360: ", alg(), "\n";</p>
    
    <p>And that is it for those olg blog posts! Was a fun trip down memory lane.</p>
