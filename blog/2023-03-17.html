    <h1>Moved to GitHub Pages</h1>
    <p>Greetings everyone! So this site has changed a bit. I recently purchased my first domain: <a href="https://travisdowd.xyz">travisdowd.xyz</a>, and moved my old site <a href="https://teaskittle.neocities.org">teaskittle.neocities.org</a> over to GitHub Pages. Also, I simplified the HTML of the site considerably. One of my main motiviations for doing so was this fantastic blog article I stumbled upon: <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/html/index.html">https://fabiensanglard.net/html/index.html</a>. Currently there is no CSS or JavaScript on this site, just pure and raw HTML.
      <br>
      Another place I gained some inspriation from are, pardon my French, the <i>fucking</i> websites. These site are trying to prove the point that you don't need to overcomplicate things on the web, here are the links to those:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherfuckingwebsite.com</a>
        <li><a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com</a>
        <li><a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">thebestmotherfucking.website</a>
      </ul>
      Overall I quite like the simplicity of these sites, especially since I am not wanting to be a web desisigner. Over designing a simple site such as this is not needed. Plus, this ensures my site will run on a potato with an Internert connecton. That is all I have for this simple update today. Happy Saint Patrick's day everyone!
